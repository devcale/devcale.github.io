## Who am I?

 I'm a Software Engineer who recently completed my Computer and Systems Engineering studies at Universidad de los Andes. I count with 4 months of internship experience in software engineering, I have developed security related functionalities for applications which are in use by more than 5M users.

Some examples are:

- I developed the contextual authentication microservice for Twilio's Authy, containerized in Docker, implemented in Golang, which captures user data and uses an anomaly detection algorithm for the analysis of each login event.

- I implemented the anomaly detection algorithm using Golang. It analyzes the user's context data and returns the probability that the login event contains anomalous behavior. This algorithm adds flexibility and robustness to Authy's multi-factor authentication service.

- I designed and implemented the NoSQL database schema in AWS DynamoDB for authentication event handling, which makes use of global and secondary indexes for optimization and scalable handling of over a thousand login attempts per second.

I get excited for opportunities that allow me to showcase my knowledge in both software development and cybersecurity, building software that is secure, reliable and highly efficient.
